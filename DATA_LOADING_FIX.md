# Data Loading Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **API Data Structure Mismatch**
- **Problem**: The API uses different field names than expected
- **Solution**: Updated field mappings in API service
  - `game_date` → `start_time_utc` 
  - `team_score`/`opponent_score` → `score_team`/`score_opponent`
  - Added handling for `'Pending'` game status

### 2. **Dashboard Initialization**
- **Problem**: Dashboard `onMounted` function was incomplete
- **Solution**: Added full initialization logic to load team data and configure components

### 3. **Team Selection for Data Availability**
- **Problem**: UCSD Baseball had no completed games in the API
- **Solution**: Switched default team to UCSD Men's Basketball which has actual game data

### 4. **Game Filtering Logic**
- **Problem**: Filters not accounting for 'Pending' status
- **Solution**: Updated filters to properly distinguish:
  - **Upcoming Games**: `game_outcome === null` OR `game_outcome === 'Pending'`
  - **Recent Games**: `game_outcome !== null` AND `game_outcome !== 'Pending'`

### 5. **Recent Results Limit**
- **Updated**: Changed from 10 to 5 games as requested

## Current Configuration

### Default Team: UCSD Men's Basketball
- ✅ Has actual completed games with scores
- ✅ Has proper game dates (`start_time_utc`)
- ✅ Shows Triton logo correctly
- ✅ Has both recent games and upcoming games

### Data Display Strategy
1. **Upcoming Games Section**:
   - Shows next upcoming game if available
   - Falls back to most recent completed game with "SCHEDULE PENDING" message
   
2. **Recent Results Section**:
   - Shows last 5 completed games
   - Displays scores, dates, and outcomes
   
3. **Standings Section**:
   - Shows conference standings for the selected sport
   - Highlights UCSD teams

## Verification Commands

Test that data is now loading:
```bash
# Check UCSD Men's Basketball recent games
curl -s "https://34g1eh6ord.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/New_test/sports-events" | jq '.[] | select(.team_name == "UCSD Men'\''s Basketball") | select(.game_outcome != "Pending") | {start_time_utc, opponent_name, game_outcome}'
```

## Expected Behavior

With these fixes, the dashboard should now display:
- ✅ UCSD Men's Basketball as the current team
- ✅ Triton logo in the header
- ✅ Recent completed games in the Recent Results section
- ✅ Either upcoming games or last completed game in Upcoming Games section
- ✅ Conference standings with UCSD teams highlighted

The application will now show actual data instead of empty sections!
