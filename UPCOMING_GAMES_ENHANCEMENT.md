# UpcomingGames Enhancement Summary

## ‚úÖ Opponent Logo Logic Updated

### Key Changes:
1. **API-Only Logo Usage**: Now only uses `opponent_logo_url` directly from API response
2. **No Fallback URLs**: Removed all default logo fallbacks and URL construction logic
3. **Pending Placeholder**: Shows "PENDING" text in a dashed border box when no logo available
4. **Comprehensive Debugging**: Added detailed console logging for logo availability and API responses

### Visual Updates:
- **Smaller Font Sizes**: Reduced VS text from 2em to 1.4em, other elements proportionally smaller
- **Grey/White Color Scheme**: Matches design with white for main text, grey (#cccccc) for labels
- **Enhanced Schedule Pending**: More prominent warning when showing past games with ‚ö†Ô∏è icon

### Debugging Features:
- **API Response Logging**: Detailed logs of upcoming/recent games with logo availability
- **Image Load/Error Handlers**: Tracks successful/failed logo loading
- **State Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of component state changes
- **Final State Summary**: Logs the complete final state after data processing

### Error Handling:
- **Graceful Logo Failures**: Shows PENDING placeholder instead of broken images
- **Fallback Game Logic**: Uses most recent game when no upcoming games available
- **Clear User Messaging**: Prominent "NEW SCHEDULE PENDING" message for past games

### CSS Features:
- **Pending Logo Styling**: Dashed border box (80px √ó 80px) with centered PENDING text
- **Mobile Responsive**: Adapts pending placeholder size (50px √ó 50px) on mobile
- **Consistent Design**: Matches overall app color scheme and typography
